# BikeShare Capstone
In this capstone, I conducted a thorough analysis of bike share data by consolidating information from various monthly datasets. After loading necessary libraries, I cleaned and organized the data, creating additional informative columns. I then focused on grouping and summarizing the data to extract meaningful insights. Visualization played a crucial role, with bar plots showcasing total rides per day of the week and per month, along with a pie chart illustrating the distribution of users between casual and member types. Average ride times were also examined, offering a comprehensive view of bike share patterns over the specified timeframe. This analysis provides valuable information on user behavior, usage patterns, and trends in the bike share program.
